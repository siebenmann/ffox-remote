== ffox-remote: lightweight remote control for Unix Firefox

A running Firefox can be remotely controlled to do things like open new
URLs; the mechanisms for this are platform dependent. Normal people do
this by running Firefox again, for example on the command line by going
'firefox NEW-URL', but it turns out that this has a number of drawbacks
(including requiring Firefox itself to start up, which is not necessarily
fast).

ffox-remote is a (Go) program that speaks Firefox's remote control
protocol on Unix/X. More specifically it speaks the newer and more arcane
remote control protocol, instead of the older and simpler protocol that
was used to implement Firefox's '-remote' command line argument and
which a number of additional tools can use. A program to speak the new
protocol has become necessary because Mozilla has now removed support
for the old protocol from Firefox Nightly.

Because the remote control protocol works via X properties, you can
remote control a running Firefox from a remote machine through things
like X forwarding. Because it is pure Go code, it can be cross-compiled
for lightweight environments where you don't necessarily want to install
or build Firefox.

(ffox-remote uses Andrew Gallant's X Go Binding packages for the actual
X protocol communication, https://github.com/BurntSushi/xgb and
https://github.com/BurntSushi/xgbutil .)

IMPORTANT NOTE: At the moment ffox-remote will not remote control your
Firefox, only Chris Siebenmann's specially hacked Firefox. See the X
property names at the start of main.go and the comment there. This will
be fixed someday.
